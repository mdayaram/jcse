Jesus Collaborative Story Experience
====

Hello and welcome to the Jesus Collaborative Story Experience.

Before we begin, keep in mind that your fellow Agents of Deception have all received nearly identical emails and it is vital that your Personal Assignment, found in bold at the bottom, remain absolutely secret. From it you will construct your chapter. The chapters then be given at random and without attribution to another author for reading. Thusly we will have a game of matching the work to the anonymous writer. Any Agents of Incomplete Participation may opt out of this and read their own chapter.

You will also complete a second, much shorter piece of writing, known as the finale. Whereas your chapter will be read by your peers and in random order, your finale will be read by you and in the proper sequence, thus providing the thrilling conclusion. Chapters should contain roughly 1500 words and Finales no more than 500, though wide deviations from these figures are acceptable.

To best support any zaniness you wish to include, both the outlines and overall plot are kept simple and easy to follow. The outlined events must be included in your writing, but feel free to make something else the main focus. By contrast the characters are described in some detail, but need not be followed accurately. They are provided merely to flesh out the relationships between the individuals and provide points of nucleation for plot ideas. Change their appearance and personality as desired.

The deadline is *February 12*. Remember to provide [dramatic] stupendously awesome or [do the YMCA hand motions] bizarre notes on how the chapter should be read. Most of all, have fun!

## Background

Sanders and Lily are performers in some sort of artistic endeavor (film, interpretive dance, yodeling, hologram swirling, whatever). They could be two performers out of a larger group. Hort has direct oversight over the performance and John is a vice president who controls the budget and gives “notes.” Heather is a #1 fan slash obsessive stalker.

## Characters

John Johnson Jr - Executive – Rumbling and sandy with sharp eyes and droop face. The middle aged upper management who seems to be nothing more than an embodiment of his job. Passive aggressive churlish obsequious eloquence.

Sanders Milfort - Performer– Avant garde and fluid. A tumbling glue wheel in mind splash tee shirts. Filterless and with long hair, he performs well, though unusually. Sanders has a piercing in an strange place and pale skin.

Heather Tress – Fan – A loud, pushy chatterbox. Attractive and willing to use it for personal gain, she endlessly seeks autographs or memorabilia. Often a manic pixie dream child, but in a way that can seem forced/fake, which belies a sharp mind.

Lily Summers – Performer - Suffering no fools, the tall and disciplined girl knows what she wants and goes straight for it. Her business/pleasure line is never blurred, though she indulges both with great enthusiasm. Heavily freckled.

Hort – Director – An immigrant with a heavy accent. He's eager to implement his own ideas, which can clash with those of his coworkers, but turn out well most of the time except when they don't.

Other - Add any other characters you want.
