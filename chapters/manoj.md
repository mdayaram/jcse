Manoj's Chapter
===============

"Alright everybody, take a seat," growled John.  He knew he was on thin ice already.  The show had been running for three weeks now and the turnout had been anything but grand.  He was fully aware that if he didn't find a reason for this soon, everyone would automatically blame him.  But what could he do?  It wasn't his fault that the book signing was a failure.  How could he know that people were only interested in books signed by their authors?  Ridiculous.  They had already written the entire book, why would you care if they signed it or not?  They probably had to sign some form of legal documentation in order to get the book published.  Wasn't that enough?  Besides, authors always have the most atrocious signatures.  Whilst in comparison, his signature was clearly legible script.  Not to mention Lily's beautifully caligraphied autograph.  And though not much could be said for Sanders's John Hancock, he at least was better looking than the boring posters of the book covers people usually use at such events.  Perhaps next time if he posed without his...

"So what is it?" snapped Lily, attempting to prompt John into starting his speech, whatever it may be.  She had always been impatient with John's speeches.  Boring was not the word to describe them, no, but rather, a waste of time.  It was already ten past five, and she needed to catch the quarter to six train if she wanted to make it for her audition tonight.  It wasn't betrayal, she told herself quietly, she was simply advancing her career forward.  Perhaps the show could survive without her, no, clearly it could.  Sanders was a wonderful performer, though not to bright, he definitely had the skills, and the body to boot.

"No!" she squealed quietly.

"Is everything alright Lil?" muttered Sanders, charmingly elbowing her on her arm.

"Yes, I am fine." She had to be more careful.  She couldn't think of Sanders that way, at least not until after she left the show.  *Leaving the show, it's not a betrayal,* she thought to herself.  *I'm pursuing my career, it's my life...* [echo 'betrayal' and my life' 4 times, alternating the two, getting softer each time].

"Guys, come on, stop fooling around, I have important issues to discuss," started John.  "Alrighty, well, it's no surprise that our numbers are not doing so good."

"What numbers?" asked Sander's sincerely.  Immediately he imagined a poor number eight, tucked in bed with a thermometer in its mouth.  Poor thing, he thought to himself.

[very angry] "Your numbers!  I must say, sometimes I feel like I do all the work around here.  If you guys weren't fooling around all day in your auditorium, maybe you could help come up with ideas on how to get an audience.  But no, it's ok, good ol' triple J will take care of it, and you know, what, that is exactly what I'm going to do, so listen up!  I have an idea..."

"I hope it's not another radio commercial, I can't really show people my abs in a radio commercial," grumbled Sanders.  Both him and Lily had gotten used to John's outbursts by now.  They were usually harmless insults followed by a sentence or two on his next scheme for attracting more audience members.  Sanders realized that the audience turnout was fairly low, but he didn't care.  He was following his passion, and that's all that mattered to him, even if his father's disagreed with him. 

"Please, I have long realized by now that I am ill equipped in figuring out the complicated audience member psyche.  Have any of you ever heard the ancient chinese proverb, 'in order to catch a you must first become a fox?'" said John.

[blank head shaking]

"Of course not you uncultured swines.  I'm not going to try to explain the stratergy now, as it's too complicated," explained John.  "Anyways, during last night's performance, I infiltrated the audience under cover, to find out what they thought about it," John remembered...

[put on a hat, or fake moustache, or anything to pretend to be someone else while making flashback noises.  If possible, have different costumes for heather and John]

> **John:** "Hey! You!"  
> **Heather:** "I WANT TO HAVE YOUR CHILDREN! TAKE ME SANDERS! I LOVE YOU LILY!"  
> **John:** "HEY!"  
> **Heather:** "Hey! Weren't they amazing!  I just love Sanders and Lily sooo much!  They're just so talented, and beautiful, and sexy, and, and, and, and" [simulate midst orgasm]  
> **John:** "You seem to like the show very much, don't you?"  
> **Heather:** "Oh yes! don't you?!?!"  
> **John:** "That's irrelevant!  Now tell me, how would you get more people to see this show!"  
> **Heather:** "Oh! Oh! I already come to all the shows, but I guess I would come even MORE if you guys held MORE shows!"  
> **John:** "Interesting, interesting..."  

[take off costumes, resume normal storytelling]

"Anyways, through my reconnaissance, I found a solution to our problem!  More shows!"
