Manoj's Finale
==============

"Where is my wig!" cried Sanders!
"Where on your head!" replied Lily, quickly drawing a moustache on her face.
"Everyone, quickly, places! The curtains up in 5!" yelled an anonymous stage director. 

Hort kept pacing back and forth.  He *tried* to work the changes that John
suggested in, but there's only so much surgery one can perform in a few days.
Pacing back and forth.  "Was it too soon for 'the power of oxyclean?"  he
thought to himself.

"And it's showtime!  Curtains up!" yelled the anonymous stage director.

"Oh shoot!" Hort hurried himself off stage as the curtains began rising.

[narrator]
Today we gather, to shed you some light.
And thank Pacific Gas and Electric for their spare shine.
Thus, Ti's a tale of woe and plight,
For two lovers, enemies, and friends alike,
Can only learn from their ancestry's mistakes,
And if so, be rewarded with the recipe of baskin robins cakes,
And if not, be punished with the taste of blandness.
For all they will have left would be nothing but sweet madness.
[end narrator]

Sander's walked briskly onto the stage, heading directly to the opposite corner
where he picked up a basketball and begun spinning it on his index finger.
Five, ten, twenty, even thirty seconds passed, the ball still spinning without
his intervention.

"Oooooh!" oooohed the crowd.  John, sitting in the front row, took a look back
to stare at everyone's faces.  He knew the crazy contraption to get the ball to
infinitely spin on Sander's finger was worth it.  Now he only needed to wait for
the punchline...

"Just do it!" yelled Lily off stage in the manliest voice she could muster.
Just then, the ball almost magically floated off of Sander's finger and
directly into a nearby basket.

It wasn't exactly what John had in mind, but he was satisfied.  Taking a look
behind him again, he could clearly tell that the crowd was simply in awe at the
brilliance of it all and were probably being subsconciously programmed into
making him millions.

Lily walked onto the stage, knowing full well the crowd was just too confused to
even realize what was going on anymore.  The playbills did not match the actual
play at all anymore.  Oh well, she thought to herserlf, this is already a lost
cause, might as well have fun with it!

"Congratulations baby! Let momma give you a big smooch!" she exclaimed as she
walked closer to Sanders, only to give him a very forceful kiss on his cheeks.

[southern mom accent]
"Look at that! My young boy's cheek, and no lipstick marks! That's Maybelline!"
Lily continued.  "Well little Adolf, did you manage to steal any Privia from
school for your poor diabetic momma?"

[southern boy accent]
"Sorry momma, they ran out of Privia, I could only get some Sweet n' Low..."

[southern mom accent]
"Now what is momma gonna do with Sweet n' Low? You know that causes cancer,
don't you?  Is that what you're trying to do? You're trying to poison your good
ol' momma by giving her the cancer from the Sweet n' Low?  You want to give you
momma the cancer.  Oh lordy lord, why have you punished me with such terrible
child!"

[southern boy accent]
"Oh momma, I'm sorry, don't'cha be crying, I'll go get some Sweet n' Low, you'll
see!" exlaimed Saners as he ran off stage.

Not having Sanders to stare at almost instantaneously reminded Lily where she
was.  She took a quick peek from the corner of her eye to see the audience,
unfortunately, all she could see was John sitting front and center givin her two
thumbs up.  She took a handkerchief off her pocket and rolled her eyes as she
began drying up her tears.
